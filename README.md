water_filter_photon.py  :Obtain the ATL03 photon data within the water body area.

all_directory.py :Denoise the ATL03 photon data within the water body area and apply the method from "A Novel Denoising Method Based on Spatial Distribution Hierarchical Clustering for Inland Lake Water Level Monitoring" to perform denoising and extract elevation.

test_ATL08.py ：Combine ATL03 and ATL08 to obtain signal photons within the water body area and derive the elevation.

test_ATL13.py ：Use ATL13 to obtain the elevation within the water body area.

The lake location and water body processing are performed using the developed software. Due to the large size of the software and data, please download it via the provided link. After unzipping, click the exe file to run it.
Note: The software is currently in the testing version and should not be distributed. "A Novel Denoising Method Based on Spatial Distribution Hierarchical Clustering for Inland Lake Water Level Monitoring" uses the software solely for water body processing.
